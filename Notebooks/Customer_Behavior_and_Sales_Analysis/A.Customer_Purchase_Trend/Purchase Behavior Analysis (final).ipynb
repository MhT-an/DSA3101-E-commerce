    "### 3.1.4 Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Top Contributor by Subcontinent**\n",
    "   - **Observation**: The United States accounts for **97.97%** of the total revenue in Northern America.\n",
    "   - **Action/Insight**: Focus marketing and sales efforts on the U.S. market, as it overwhelmingly drives the revenue in the region. Explore why the remaining subcontinent countries contribute minimal revenue and consider targeting new markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top Main Categories by Revenue**\n",
    "   - **Observation**: **Apparel** is the top category, contributing **32.23%** of total revenue, followed by **Office** (19.15%) and **Accessories** (11.94%).\n",
    "   - **Action/Insight**: Prioritize investments in **Apparel** while exploring growth opportunities in **Office** and **Accessories** categories, especially if there's room for product expansion or cross-selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Category Breakdown by Region**\n",
    "   - **Observation**: For **Apparel**, **\"not available in demo dataset\"** contributes the largest revenue (47.22%), with **California** and **New York** also being major contributors.\n",
    "   - **Action/Insight**: Investigate the reasons behind the high contribution from the **\"not available in demo dataset\"** region—this could reveal data gaps or new emerging markets worth exploring further.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Revenue Distribution for Other Categories**\n",
    "   - **Observation**: The **\"not available in demo dataset\"** region consistently leads in revenue for **Office**, **Accessories**, **Bags**, and **Electronics**.\n",
    "   - **Action/Insight**: Consider revisiting data classification and enhancing region-based targeting strategies for these categories to improve market understanding and potentially uncover overlooked opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **General Regional Insights**\n",
    "   - **Observation**: **California** and **New York** dominate revenue across most categories, while regions like **Illinois** and **Texas** contribute secondary amounts.\n",
    "   - **Action/Insight**: Tailor marketing strategies to further leverage the dominance of **California** and **New York**, while developing targeted campaigns for **Illinois** and **Texas** to increase their revenue contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the heavy revenue reliance on the U.S. market, it’s crucial to continue driving growth in top-performing regions while addressing potential data gaps (e.g., the **\"not available in demo dataset\"** region) and exploring secondary markets like **Illinois** and **Texas** to diversify revenue streams and reduce market saturation risks."

    "### 3.2.3 Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Top 5 Revenue-Generating Products**\n",
    "   - **Observation**: The **Apparel**, **Accessories**, and **Electronics** categories consistently rank among the top 5 revenue-generating products, with notable peaks during key shopping periods such as **April** (spring season) and **November-December** (holiday season).\n",
    "   - **Action/Insight**: Focus on capitalizing on seasonal demand shifts by intensifying marketing efforts and product launches for **Apparel** and **Accessories** in **April**, and for **Apparel** and **Electronics** during **November-December** for holiday promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monthly Sales Trend for Apparel and Accessories**\n",
    "   - **Observation**: **April** has the highest sales for **Apparel** and **Accessories**, likely due to the spring wardrobe refresh and **Easter** shopping.\n",
    "   - **Action/Insight**: Prepare for a surge in sales in **April** by launching targeted promotions, seasonal collections, and bundling offers for **Apparel** and **Accessories** well in advance of the spring season to capture early buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Holiday Promotions Impact (Black Friday & Christmas)**\n",
    "   - **Observation**: **Apparel** and **Electronics** see significant sales spikes in **November** and **December**, driven by **Black Friday** and **Christmas** holiday shopping.\n",
    "   - **Action/Insight**: Plan for heavy promotions and marketing campaigns for **Apparel** and **Electronics** in the months leading up to **November-December**. Early preparation for holiday discounts and exclusive offers can maximize revenue during this peak shopping period.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consistent Demand for Accessories and Office Supplies**\n",
    "   - **Observation**: There is a steady demand for **Accessories** and **Office Supplies** throughout the year, reflecting their utility-based appeal.\n",
    "   - **Action/Insight**: Maintain consistent marketing efforts for **Accessories** and **Office Supplies**, focusing on their practical, everyday value. Consider creating year-round campaigns highlighting product utility and work-from-home trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Limited Responsiveness to July 4th**\n",
    "   - **Observation**: There is minimal sales response to **July 4th** promotions, with only minor increases in **Apparel** and **Electronics**.\n",
    "   - **Action/Insight**: While **July 4th** sales may not be as impactful, consider offering targeted promotions for **Apparel** and **Electronics** with a focus on summer-specific items (e.g., summer apparel and travel electronics) to encourage purchases without relying heavily on this holiday for major revenue growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales trends show that seasonal factors such as **spring refresh** in April, and **holiday promotions** in November and December, heavily influence demand for **Apparel** and **Electronics**. There is a steady year-round demand for **Accessories** and **Office Supplies** driven by their practical nature. Focused efforts on aligning product launches and promotions with seasonal and holiday peaks will maximize sales potential, while steady marketing for utility-based products can provide consistent revenue throughout the year."

    "    * **Action/Insight:** The strong initial conversion suggests high interest, but the drop from detail views to checkout indicates potential friction in the purchase decision. Streamline the checkout process and consider exit-intent offers on the product detail page to encourage more users to proceed to checkout.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top-Performing Categories in the Funnel**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Observation:** Apparel and Accessories dominate the funnel across all stages, with Apparel seeing the highest engagement and conversion rates from click-through to completed purchase. Accessories shows high initial interest but experiences significant drop-off by the purchase stage.\n",
    "    * **Action/Insight:** Focus on optimizing the final checkout experience for Accessories, possibly through incentives like free shipping or exclusive discounts. For Apparel, maintain strong marketing efforts, as it consistently drives high conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conversion Drop in Electronics and Office Categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Observation:** Electronics and Office categories have a notable drop from product detail views to checkout, with conversion rates at **79%** and **80.2%**, respectively, from click-through to detail view.\n",
    "    * **Action/Insight:** Enhance product page content, improve pricing competitiveness, and consider offering bundled discounts for Electronics and Office to reduce drop-offs and encourage checkout. Conduct user testing to identify pain points in these categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check-Out Success for Apparel**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Observation:** Apparel maintains a strong position through the checkout stage with a **71.9%** conversion from product detail views to checkout, showing high user commitment once they view details.\n",
    "    * **Action/Insight:** Leverage this high checkout intent by promoting related items in the Apparel category or offering loyalty points for repeat purchases to capitalize on customer commitment. Limited-time offers during high-traffic periods could further increase conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conversion Challenges in \"Other\" Category at Final Stage**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Observation:** The \"Other\" category has a 115.5% rate at checkout, indicating repeated cart additions or possible data inconsistencies, followed by only a **21.3%** conversion to completed purchase. This could be due to other routes taken to the checkout stage.\n",
    "    * **Action/Insight:** Investigate the cause of the inflated checkout rate in the \"Other\" category. Improving the final purchase experience by streamlining checkout or providing order confirmation incentives could help retain these customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Apparel and Accessories lead in user interest and conversion, with Apparel showing strong performance at every funnel stage. Electronics and Office, while generating interest, experience significant drop-offs before checkout, suggesting the need for enhanced product presentation or pricing adjustments. By aligning checkout incentives with customer behavior in Accessories and investigating issues in the \"Other\" category, conversions could be further improved.\n",

    "### 3.4.3 Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Higher Engagement Leads to Purchases**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** Users who make a purchase visit the site **4.26 times**, spend **1167.34 seconds** (about 19.5 minutes) on average, and view **32.21 pages** per visit. In contrast, non-purchasers only visit **2.24 times**, spend **241.58 seconds** (about 4 minutes) on the site, and view **3.53 pages** per visit.  \n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** The discrepancy between purchase and non-purchase behavior is glaring. Users who make a purchase are clearly more engaged—spending more time and exploring more products. Non-purchasers are disengaged and likely drop off early. Focus on **driving higher engagement** from non-purchasers. Implement retargeting strategies that highlight products based on previous browsing, introduce **product recommendations** on the homepage, and provide **personalized content** to entice users to return. Consider using exit-intent popups with discounts or incentives to get users to stay longer and explore more.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Low Engagement Signals Missed Opportunities**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** Non-purchasers are not exploring the site deeply, with a **3.53-page** average compared to **32.21 pages** for those who complete a purchase. This suggests users are either not finding what they want quickly or are not compelled to engage with the site content.  \n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** You’re losing potential customers by not capturing their interest enough to explore. **Improve the browsing experience**—simplify product discovery through better filtering, more intuitive navigation, and personalized product recommendations. **Interactive content** like videos or quizzes can also significantly boost user engagement, making them feel more involved in their decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Spent on Site Directly Correlates to Purchases**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** Purchase-driven users spend nearly **5 times more time** on site compared to non-purchasers, signaling that higher engagement directly correlates with purchase intent.  \n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** There’s a clear connection between time spent on-site and conversions. If non-purchasers are not spending time on the site, you're losing them early. **Retarget users** who visit briefly or drop off quickly with engaging content. Consider **personalized email campaigns** based on browsing history or offer dynamic site banners that highlight new or popular products. You need to create more reasons for users to linger, explore, and commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conversion Opportunity in Low-Engagement Visitors**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** The stark contrast between high-engagement purchasers and low-engagement non-purchasers highlights a clear opportunity. Non-purchasers need to be re-engaged or converted before they abandon the site.  \n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** Focus on reducing **friction points** in the user journey. If users are not purchasing due to the browsing experience, address those friction points: slow load times, poor product images, unclear calls to action, or overly complicated checkouts. Consider offering a **first-time visitor discount** or an exclusive incentive if they return to the site and engage more.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Funnel Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** The significant differences in metrics (visit frequency, time on site, and pages viewed) between purchasers and non-purchasers indicate that engagement metrics could be used as a **strong predictor** for conversion success.  \n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** Focus on optimizing the stages where non-purchasers drop off. **Drive engagement earlier in the funnel**, and make sure every page is optimized for discovery and conversion. Introduce **behavior-triggered content** to keep users moving down the funnel—if a user spends a certain amount of time on a product page or visits multiple pages, prompt them with personalized offers or a reminder of their browsing history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Purchasers engage deeply—visiting more often, spending more time, and exploring more products. If you can **increase engagement for non-purchasers**, you’ll likely see a significant lift in conversions. It’s all about creating a **compelling, immersive experience** that keeps users on-site longer, nudges them to explore more, and helps them feel like they are getting value with every click. Non-purchasers need more incentives to return and deeper engagement from the start."

    "### Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Higher Revenue from Frequent Visitors**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** Frequent visitors generate significantly higher revenue per visit, with a **mean revenue of 337.55** compared to **142.75** for occasional visitors and just **100.22** for first-time visitors. However, the total revenue from frequent visitors is lower due to fewer transactions (1817 transactions vs. 5633 for occasional visitors).\n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** **Frequent visitors are high-value customers**, but the lower total transactions suggest they may not be as numerous. To maximize the potential of frequent visitors, consider implementing **loyalty programs** or exclusive offers to encourage repeat purchases. You could also enhance **personalization** in the form of product recommendations or tailored discounts to drive more frequent purchases from this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Occasional Visitors Drive Most Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** Occasional visitors make up the largest share of total transactions (**5633 transactions**) despite having a lower mean revenue per visit (**142.75**). This suggests they are more likely to make a purchase, even though their revenue contribution is lower.\n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** Since **occasional visitors** have high transaction volume but lower revenue per visit, it's essential to increase their average spend. Implement **cross-selling** or **upselling** strategies to increase average order value (AOV) and offer incentives like **free shipping thresholds** or discounts on bundled items. Additionally, consider retargeting ads or personalized promotions based on their past behavior to increase the likelihood of additional purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **First-Time Visitors Have Low Conversion and Revenue**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** First-time visitors show the lowest mean revenue (**100.22**) and make the fewest transactions (**4665 total transactions**). This indicates that while they bring in revenue, their engagement is minimal, and they don’t convert as frequently.\n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** To improve the conversion rates of **first-time visitors**, consider offering **first-purchase incentives** like discounts or free shipping. You could also enhance the **onboarding experience** with tailored product recommendations or guided shopping tours to help them explore the site more effectively. **Exit-intent popups** or follow-up email campaigns could also encourage them to complete their first purchase, increasing the likelihood of them becoming occasional or frequent visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Focus on High-Value Customers to Increase Revenue**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** Although frequent visitors generate the highest **mean revenue per transaction**, they account for a lower total revenue due to fewer overall transactions. Occasional visitors, while having lower average revenue, generate more transactions and drive significant overall revenue.\n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** There’s an opportunity to **balance focus** between occasional and frequent visitors. While occasional visitors are more numerous and contribute heavily to transactions, **frequent visitors could be encouraged to increase their transaction frequency**. To do this, you might consider offering loyalty rewards or **personalized incentives** to encourage more frequent purchases. Also, ensure that frequent visitors have a seamless **user experience**, as a better user journey can increase the likelihood of them purchasing more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visitor Categories as a Predictor for Revenue Growth**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** The differences in **mean revenue** and **mean transactions** across the three visitor categories suggest that **visitor frequency and engagement** are key drivers of revenue performance. Frequent visitors, while spending more per visit, don’t drive as many transactions, whereas occasional visitors bring in more volume, albeit at lower individual revenue.\n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** Segment your marketing strategies based on these categories:\n",
    "    - **For frequent visitors**: Focus on **retention strategies** to increase the number of transactions, such as loyalty programs or personalized offers based on past purchases.\n",
    "    - **For occasional visitors**: Consider introducing **seasonal promotions** or **limited-time offers** to encourage more frequent visits and increase their average spend per visit.\n",
    "    - **For first-time visitors**: Focus on converting them into occasional or frequent visitors by using **strong first-purchase incentives**, nurturing them with personalized content, and ensuring a smooth onboarding experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the behavior and revenue patterns across **first-time**, **occasional**, and **frequent visitors** reveals clear opportunities for revenue growth. Frequent visitors are high-value customers who could contribute more if their frequency of transactions increases. Occasional visitors, while contributing significantly to total transactions, could benefit from strategies aimed at increasing their average revenue per visit. First-time visitors need strong incentives and engagement strategies to encourage repeat visits and conversions. Tailoring marketing efforts to each visitor category and focusing on **personalization, loyalty, and targeted offers** will help drive higher conversions and revenue across all visitor segments."

    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dominance of Non-Price Sensitive Customers**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** The vast majority of customers fall into the **Non Price-Sensitive** category, with **706,791** customers compared to only **6,224** in the **Medium Price-Sensitive** group and **1,152** in the **Very Price-Sensitive** group. This suggests that most of your customer base does not respond strongly to changes in price.\n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** **Non-price sensitive** customers make up the bulk of your business, so optimizing for them should be a priority. Focus on **enhancing product quality**, **premium features**, or **exclusive services** to appeal to this group. Since price is not a major consideration, focus on improving **brand loyalty**, **product assortment**, and **personalized experiences** that justify the higher spend. Consider **upselling** or **bundling** premium products to increase their average ticket size even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Small but Engaged Medium Price-Sensitive Group**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** The **Medium Price-Sensitive** segment, with **6,224 customers**, represents a smaller but potentially profitable group. They are willing to pay more than the **Very Price-Sensitive** group (who typically have a lower ticket size), but still exhibit some sensitivity to pricing.\n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** **Tailor promotions** for this group to align with their willingness to spend, such as offering **value-driven bundles** or **discounts on higher-ticket items** that feel like a good deal. Consider **tiered loyalty programs** or **targeted email marketing** with personalized offers that create a sense of exclusivity while still being mindful of their price sensitivity. Offering **loyalty rewards** or access to **limited-time offers** might help you increase their overall spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **High-Value but Small Non-Price Sensitive Group**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** The **Non Price-Sensitive** group, though the largest in terms of customer count, may still have the highest revenue potential due to their higher ticket sizes, with customers willing to spend up to **$2,000**. This group has high transaction values and may be responsible for a significant portion of total revenue.\n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** Since these customers are not as price-sensitive, focus on **luxury or premium product offerings**, **personalized experiences**, and **VIP services**. Create **premium loyalty programs**, exclusive product lines, or **early access to new collections** to cater to their spending habits. Additionally, consider **personalized upselling** based on their past purchasing behavior and **premium pricing strategies** that reinforce the exclusivity of the offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Opportunity to Target Very Price-Sensitive Group**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** The **Very Price-Sensitive** group, though the smallest with only **1,152 customers**, exhibits the lowest average ticket size, falling between **$2.5 to $20**. These customers are very conscious of their spending and are likely looking for the best deals.\n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** For this group, focus on **discounts, deals, and special offers**. **Flash sales**, **bundling** low-cost items, or **loyalty programs** that reward frequent, low-value purchases can be an effective way to retain and encourage more frequent purchases. Also, **price-matching** or **guaranteeing the best price** could help reduce friction for this group. It's also important to **limit upsell attempts** that might overwhelm them with higher-priced offers. Instead, create **budget-friendly bundles** or **value packs** that maximize the perceived value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Price Sensitivity and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Observation:** While **Non Price-Sensitive** customers may not be as numerous, they likely generate a **disproportionately high amount of revenue** due to their larger ticket sizes. In contrast, the **Very Price-Sensitive** group may make more frequent, smaller purchases, but they contribute less revenue overall.\n",
    "  * **Action/Insight:** **Maximize CLV for each segment**:\n",
    "    - **Non Price-Sensitive**: Focus on **retention strategies** that ensure repeat purchases, such as **personalized outreach** or VIP treatment (e.g., personalized shopping experiences, exclusive offers, or concierge services).\n",
    "    - **Medium Price-Sensitive**: Build loyalty with a balanced approach—provide deals that appeal to their value-conscious mindset without significantly cutting into margins. Consider **time-limited offers** or **membership programs** for this group to increase overall engagement.\n",
    "    - **Very Price-Sensitive**: Target this group with **cost-effective ways to increase their engagement**, such as **referral programs** or **rewarding frequent small purchases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer base is heavily skewed towards **Non Price-Sensitive** customers, who have the highest revenue potential due to their larger ticket sizes. However, each segment requires tailored strategies:\n",
    "- **Non Price-Sensitive** customers should be nurtured through **premium offerings** and **personalized experiences**.\n",
    "- **Medium Price-Sensitive** customers can be effectively targeted with **value-driven promotions** that balance price sensitivity with quality.\n",
    "- **Very Price-Sensitive** customers should be incentivized through **discounts, bundles, and frequent promotions** that appeal to their price-conscious mindset."
